and will own all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the

including but not limited to the interpretation, validity, enforceability and performance of this
Agreement, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of California,
without regard to or application of any of California’s conflict of law rules. Any legal suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be commenced in the federal courts in
the Northern District of California or in the state courts in Santa Clara County, California, and each
party hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such suit,
action or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, InvenSense may seek interim or injunctive
relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights.

10.5 Severability; Waiver. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid,
unenforceable, overbroad, or illegal, the validity or enforceability of the other provisions will not be
affected and any the affected provision will be construed by limiting or reducing it, so as to be
enforceable with applicable law. No waiver by InvenSense of any right under this Agreement will be
construed as a waiver of any other right or breach. Licensee must comply with all applicable laws

matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous correspondence, negotiations,
agreements and understandings between Licensee and InvenSense, and any representations and
warranties, both oral and written.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Licensee has entered into a
separate confidentiality agreement or non‐disclosure agreement with InvenSense with respect to
the confidentiality of the Licensed Materials, then that agreement will continue to apply with
respect to that subject matter to the extent that it is more protective of the confidentiality of the
Licensed Materials than this Agreement. No modification, cancellation, or amendment of this
Agreement will be binding unless executed in writing (referencing this Agreement) by Licensee and a
duly authorized officer of InvenSense.
